# 0x06. Regular Expressions

## Background Context
This project focuses on building regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, the regular expression engine used by Ruby. You will be tasked with creating various Ruby scripts that perform pattern matching using regular expressions. Oniguruma provides powerful capabilities for matching patterns in strings, and your goal is to utilize this library effectively in different tasks.

## Requirements
Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
File Endings: All files should end with a new line
Executable Scripts: Ensure all Ruby scripts are executable
Shebang: Each Ruby script should start with #!/usr/bin/env ruby
Regular Expressions: All regex should be compatible with the Oniguruma library


## Tasks

Task 0: Simply Matching School
Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and matches the word "School".
File: 0-simply_match_school.rb

Task 1: Repetition Token #0
Create a Ruby script that matches repetitions of the specified token.
File: 1-repetition_token_0.rb

Task 2: Repetition Token #1
Create a Ruby script that matches another pattern with repetition.
File: 2-repetition_token_1.rb

Task 3: Repetition Token #2
Create a Ruby script that matches a more complex repetition pattern.
File: 3-repetition_token_2.rb

Task 4: Repetition Token #3
Create a Ruby script that matches a repetition pattern without square brackets.
File: 4-repetition_token_3.rb

Task 5: Not Quite HBTN Yet
Create a Ruby script that matches strings that start with "h" and end with "n", with any single character in between.
File: 5-beginning_and_end.rb

Task 6: Call Me Maybe
Create a Ruby script that matches a 10-digit phone number.
File: 6-phone_number.rb

Task 7: OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?
Create a Ruby script that matches only capital letters in a string.
File: 7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb

Task 8: Textme
Create a Ruby script that extracts specific details (sender, receiver, and flags) from text messages in a log file and formats them accordingly.
File: 100-textme.rb

Usage Example
For each script, you can use the following format to test its functionality:

```bash
./<script_name>.rb <input_string>
```
